# js-helpers

This is a small library of helper functions that I use to assist in my personal development.
A lot of inspiration found in Haskell

## Functions:
`require('./')`
$: (a -> b) -> a -> b
flip: (a -> b -> c) -> (b -> a -> c)
log: wraps a function with logging
bool: (False Fn/result) -> (True fn/result) -> (Condition fn/input) -> ...args
